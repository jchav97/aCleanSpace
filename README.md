## About 
Our web application provides our users with a decentralized platform to share their voluntarism, gain both popularity and monetary rewards, and compete against each other in monthly leader boards. Liking posts, sharing experiences, and being an active member leads to higher points, higher ranking status, more badges, and end of season rewards!

## Point based ladder
Our point based system rewards users for engagement with their commnuity and with posts describing their activities. It's held together by a leaderboard where users can compete with one another for bragging rights or even some cash!

## Leaderboard
Using a revolving leaderboard that resets once a month, we hope to allow any user to be able to reach the top without "catching up" to power users. You can also earn points through gym badges, interaction with other users and doing your own activities for good!

## How we built it
Using node.js as our backend framework, we developed the application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bootstrap4 was used in the styling and MongoDB was used for data persistence. We ultimately hosted the application on a DigitalOcean server running node.js and deployed it using our domain name, aclean.space.

## Running application

          1. Git clone this repo
          2. Run `npm install`
          3. Run `node app.js`

## What's next
Bigger and better things. We plan to implement images along side our posts to allow users to show proof and the results of their volunteerism. We plan to have a practical categories options to sort our feed from what categories that the user would like to see. Additionally, we would like to increase and grow the number of badges that you can receive and where you can show off your social good pride!
